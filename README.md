JBioFramework resources for protein separation and analysis

This repository is designed to create resources for simulated protein separation and analysis, 
primarily as FASTA files containing additional data. The program that will use these files is a 
Java simulation of protein separations called JBioFramework, which is encoded in Java. The eventual 
goal will be to convert the simulation itself to Python in a Jupyter notebook.
