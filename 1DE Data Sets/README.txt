Data sets are generating by simulating Size Exclusion separation from 3.0-60.0 kDa, Ion Exchange with Q (Triethylamine+) media and a histidine sensitive metal affinity.
All separations simulated at pH of 7.0

Tagged proteins have the IDs in the FASTAs of P40714 and Q8D0D8 for E. Coli and Y. Pestis respectively.
