Process order was Ion Exchange -> Gel Filtration -> Affinity Chromatography
Fraction 1 of the ion exchange was used for gel filtration.
Fraction 4 of the gel filtration was used for the affinity.
In order to get a better data set, I used a different proteome. The original file is yersinia_pestis[632].fasta, it was here when I got the repository rather than the previous version I received from the UniProt API.
